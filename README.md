# covid19modeling
A simple Java program to model the COVID-19 epidemic

The "data" directory contains the .csv files that are used for the graphs of predicted
COVID-19 cases shown at https://covid19science.blogspot.com/p/covid-19-model-projections.html
These projects are based on a different model that extrapolates observed trends in the
COVID-19 case data for each state, as explained at 
https://covid19science.blogspot.com/2020/04/data-trend-model-details.html
